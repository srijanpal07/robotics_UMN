this is my first review and is because this place made me want to make a yelp just to review them,0
so many chinese restaurants offer the basic chinese food and seem to use really small shrimp and unrecognizable meats,-1
previous visits merited satisfied customers including my friends fiancee who is notoriously hard to please hes not so much picky as a perfectionist with high expectations for quality food,1
they have a jelly fish tank,0
the decor was confusing though,-1
i had it  months ago when they lost  pieces of our clothes,-1
they must forget some people dont travel often,-1
i would be there way too often and would probably give them all of my money,1

the rating of korrys on yelp is accurate,0
i was not sure what to expect,0
good polish selection and front desk is the most positive point of this place,1
or was he q ended up taking us back but since craig quit had  people in a van for maybe   some people were sitting on the floor if ur in the back of the bus you get no ac but on the way out i sat up front passenger an didnt feel air driving the atv was definitely worth the time here worth the moneyis your decision everything here in vegas is overpriced  everythingdidnt grab a receipt  didnt think hell would happen or would have turned them in the the better business bureau,-1
not a place where they love to recommend things they like to keep the line moving so decide what you want before you get up to order,-1
after that day i drove to stonecrest for the ups store there or to the one in the quail corners shopping center,0
she told me she would check and see if the rooms were available for the days i needed and get back to me within  hours,0

this is probably not a huge concern for most people because i sat down and ate the whole thing in  minutes,1
he said it was ok  first thing you know the owner came over to try to make it right,1
her  of course,0
the monorail stops in the lobby of the hotel so getting around the city would have been easy,1
cooks walking around listening to music like it wasnt busy,-1
i wish it did because that is what this store deserves,0
but the best part by far was the duck breast,1
driving here wasnt bad its not too deep in china town that traffic will be horrendous,1
she would not leave the table,-1
weve been to streets of new york before at the centennial hills location and it was good,1
good thing i had a fandango gift card for the tickets,1

reserved and paid for the car online   got there and service member offered free upgrade because no compact car was available,1
the carbonara was cheesy with lots of bacon,1
a wheelchair can navigate its entrance,1
this traces back to the days of the steel workers who had no easy way of eatingpacking the coleslaw and fries so what easier way to consume it than to stuff it into the sandwich,0
this is a transplant of a small buffalony hotdog chain,0
during our twenty minute break out of curiosity i decided to browse around the appliance section just to get an idea of the layout of the department ill be at another store but the layouts are all similar,0
i just have one minor complaint,-1

its was my job to grab lunch for the group,0
i think they literally pulled them out of the refrigerator and microwave them and brought them to our table,-1
i dont even remember what i look like with black hair,0
one thing this place could do better though is to have a menu,-1
for  we were not expecting a full salad bowl but that is exactly what we got,1
 things that really stood out on craptastic service,-1
be prepared to dig deep into your wallet though because this place is not inexpensive,-1
my only concern not even a complaint was the portion of the dish,-1
the decor is dated and the tables are sticky,-1
i would say they intentionally to do that,0
there were people with the same size party and no reservation that got seated before us so it wasnt off to a great start,-1

i would recommend getting a set of training sessions,0
it seemed like they always had some kind of promotion going on,1
i had my kids with me and to me as a server i would get it quicker than that,-1
the menu is a relic of  greeb fare that would even make a wetherspoons look gourmet,-1
my only suggestion here is to make sure that you blend the meat in with the macaroni and cheese otherwise the flavours from the pork ribs are a little too much and the macaroni is simple blandboring,-1
if you dont have a groupon and are planning to eat at this place you are out of your mind,-1
only complaint would be that the green sauce wasnt spicy enough just tasted plain,-1

the line is usually fast the longest i had to wait was  minutes,1
they really try to go that extra mile at the elara,1
if i could give them zeros stars i would,-1
the prices are not as great as some are saying especially for this quality,-1
it is a small place so probably not a good place for large groups,-1
i decided to start with the african peanut stew which consists of sweet potatoes ginger and coriander,0
the crew also never tried to upsell procedures,1
this time i asked for the unavailable cod  ended up ordering deepfried trout  chips a tasty fish that i grew up on a couple of bites of fish  fries and i was frustrated and done,-1

i would recommend using priceline when booking your hotel,1
its the one more expensive place in madison that ive consistently thought this would survive in a bigger city,1

heaven in a box is what they should have called it,1
to put it in perspective the best thing our neighbors have done is drunkenly throw up taco bell on our shared entry steps twice in the last two months,-1
pretty simple  be respectful and everything should be alright,0
we told the waitress and spoke to the manager and instead of taking that dish off the bill entirely they discounted our bill by ,1
she took it way better than i would have,1
for lack of a better way to put it sooooooo gooood,1
baby back ribs were not cooked enough and had funny taste,-1
parking can be tough,-1
i dont write reviews but was really compelled to because of our experience with chopstix last night,0
he is in and out in  minutes and cares not for your questions or concerns,-1
we ordered the pretzels and the chefs board as apps,0
she did not do any homework and finding a house with her was like taking a tour of the whole neighborhood,-1
i think they thought we were doing family style which we were not,-1
i have a shellfish allergy,0
we came on sunday morning and the place was almost empty,0
chanda lives on site so she is always around causing a stir being hands on with your position is great in most cases however in this case chanda is just messy,-1
while dining in u have unlimited refills and condimentsyippy,1
havent been back since the health scare but decided to go yesterday around ,0
first off,0
fries are prepared and blanched everyday,1
we called hsa and one of the supervisors got us an appointment for monday morning,1
was told by another vet that it would be an hour wait as my dog was bleeding badly,0
so we get this plan laid out and start getting moulds like  a year in advance,0
it is so cheap,1
with this dish my dad believed that he has had better fried rice,-1
if you need to go to aa  heres the place to go,1
i highly recommend asking for both and paying extra,1
the initial arrival was good got in and out in  hour,1
i received a  discount on a future meal,1
it states it not good for kids i disagree we took our youth soccer club here  year olds and they loved it,1
as for the store itself i have only found the employees helpful and knowledgeable,1
since i was so used to how slow the pharmcist service was at walgreen specifically the one located at alma school  germann i didnt even bother pulling up the drive way expecting my meds to be ready,-1
i had this company clean my house a year ago and they did a great job,1
im tired of going into places like not just coffee or hex and not being able to order a small,-1
ive shopped here for many years and not had bad experiences,1
if you want quality pizza go to nellos,1
in the end i got her a half order of steak and fries with ketchup which she enjoyed,1
when i used him in the past his attitude was very nonchalant but i thought who couldnt service a unit right,-1
owner is crazy,-1
they had no problems charging my credit card immediately but they cancelled my appointment ten hours ahead they emailed me past midnight,-1
he saw the  min  heard it because i then put it on speaker,0
we show up and i explain the situation to our waiter who brought my husband and i the limited groupon menu our friend ordered off the regular menu,0
i know they have polite employees as i experienced with the first gentleman,1
as with other trades the guys that did come out and do the work were not quite as nice etc,-1
open  check out times are  am,0
its like going to eat at disneyland and surprised everything is so damn expensive,-1
its disappointing finding out shes transferring to a laseraway in nyc,-1
although the beef sandwich was pretty good,1
i used to be a manager of popeyes in maryland in washington dc,0
of course the item we picked was out of stock yet they had one on the floor,-1
unfortunately last year my insurance was changed and i had to see a different group of doctors,-1
we made a few stops and then i finally made it to my hotel about an hour and some change after i landed,0
called frederick and sons they came out detected a huge leak right away and said adding freon would only help for like a week,0
thanks us postal service,1
we split our entire meal including the salad,0
of course i wasnt weak minded as his jedi mind trick failed,-1
we did some shopping on the strip and we we passed again at  there was a huge line waiting to get in,-1
we were uncomfortably close to our strangerneighbors,-1
this is a cafeteria style where you get in  line order pay get your own drink and silverware and then someone delivers the food to your table,0
i was stuck,-1
we were told that there will be renovations to upgrade this already fine place,1
yes our complex has had break ins,-1
but although my hair appeared to be bad it was actually much much worse,-1
takes your car for joy rides then says nothing is wrong,-1
the soup french onion was the best part of the meal,1
luckily a tall skinny male server came an took it and brought our card,1
i know how things are supposed to taste having made my own bulgogi from scratch,0
just take note that it seems that the menu on their site is outdated,-1
thank you flamingo for helping me when the cosmopolitan racially profiled me,1
unfortunately for me it was a bad alternator,-1
i liked how it wasnt as noisy and busy since they didnt have a casino,1
parking is sometimes hard to find,-1
i reached out to hillside via yelps message system,0
the only bummer is that the audience wasnt into it at the show we went to which sucked some of the life out of the place,-1
but amazon wouldnt partner with anyone that couldnt fulfill my delivery efficiently and competently right ,-1
but still thanks to rachel for helping me with great patience,1
they dont stuff the sushi rolls with tons of rice,1
i will say that our driver was very kind and friendly,1
like we were supposed to know,-1
the wheels werent even wiped down,-1
ich kann das lokal nur weiter empfehlen,0
this place kills it,1
regarding dosas the less said the better,-1
the fries were sweet and salty with what seems to be house made ketchup,1
drove over to precision based on yelp,0
toronto island bbq and beer company,0
it was the best part of the meal,1
while the service was impeccable i am more interested in how good the food is,1
so cool,1
when i finally did i was like a kid in a candy store,1
they need to trim the meat better,-1
i spent months planning this event and  days before the party i realized i forgot about the cake,0
i come here once in a while to discuss business or study and its generally pleasant,1
this is a review specifically of sketchers,0
so i would literally stay anywhere else in las vegas but here,-1
strangely the moment the driver realized what was happening he was able to pull over,0
i discovered this place last week ,0
very small inside though,-1
my son had short ribs and that was the best out of all the meals,1
good luck to you and yours with the bakery phx,1
the beef was on the tougher side,-1
as youre walking by a table  just say hey,0
while in the airport i wish not to be delayed through security i wish for a quiet companion next to me on the flight and sometimes i wish for a decent fast bar to have a beer while waiting,0
so i bring it back to brake masters,0
i would add a photo but i ate everything too quickly,1
based on my recent experience  go elsewhere,-1
the exterior design who the hell sees water fountain in front of mcd,-1
i think part of your job should be to know at least a few of those shooters and beers to recommend to customers,-1
a huge two shower head stand up shower,0
talk about gernerousity and hospitality,1
we ordered the escargot to start,0
introduce yourself to your guests  hell there are only about  of them so it shouldnt tax you too much,-1
i would only trust hubbard with my children,0
i ordered the croque madame which is a ham and cheese on brioche with a fried egg on top,0
i hear the pizzas are good,1
again the location can not be beat if you want to be in the heart of old town,1
only downside to the gift shop is they didnt have a shirt in the size i wanted,-1
it left no possibility for a futile attempt to make what was damaged look undamaged,-1
this shop will take advantage of you of they know they can get away with it,-1
i kept in contact and it is now monday,0
he simply said to come back tomorrow night and he would take care of us,0
there are now only  places that come to my mind when i want gelato,0
we must have just waited  minutes when our order arrived,1
great location with parking,1
the bar was only about  full so i felt lucky to have beat the dinner rush,1
we were only moving  king bed sofa dining table   chairs  bar stools and some other various items,0
when i said thank you but we will go somewhere else she hung up on me,-1
fully gutted at that,0
my kids wanted pizza for dinner so i googled the closest pizza place near me,0
the amazing mechanic at the other shop tightened the bolt for free,1
my suggestions are to come with plenty of cash atm fee is  take their transportation and spend most of your money on the lap dances  rather than on the stage,0
you order and pay at the counter then your food is called up,0
i have told the people at the drive thru window many times but they always make it before the burger so it just sits on the counter and melts,-1
let me start by saying the food is good,1
called and asked about prices,0
now i could be wrong but isnt it the insurance agents job to make you feel like you are being taken care of,-1
the other flavoured bagels are not as good as they sit in the bin and does not move as quickly,-1
i tried my very best to keep my hand as still as possible but i was a little confused why she couldnt wait till i was at least done with the massage part of the pedi,-1
thought it would be good,1
the appetizer trio,0
we wanted to try just the korean dishes so we could compare,0
the service was fantastic,1
plus i prefer good quality durable and elegant furniture so ikea is not the place for me,-1
the next time my boyfriend and i came was during dinner,0
i got the vanilla ice cream dipped in butterscotch,0
topped with cheddar cheese and two eggs,0
so stop wasting your time and get to malees now,1
tonight i placed an order through the order up app from rbs pizza,1
instead of barely meeting expectations gene woods blew them out if the water,1
jack english and his staff specifically jan and randal are the epitome of the commercial like a good neighbor state farm is there,1
usually theres an attendant on duty wiping and sweeping,1
with all the powder sugar it can get pretty messy,-1
ive never left a restaurant more hungry than when i arrived before now,-1
we are local north olmsted resident ,0
if you want a true honest boat mechanic i strongly suggest coming to gerrys marine,1
the staff here are definitely not afraid of arguinglashing out at customers,-1
no harassment and i continue to service my vehicle there,1
we stayed at the signature in  which was a combined  bedroom  bathroom suite,0
i ate as much of the spaghetti as possible before i couldnt move anymore,0
this is not true of other shops i have been too,0
its really lovely and in a great location,1
thank you so much and if anyone else has the same issue within the starbucks app theres the history section in small text underneath the number of stars you have you can check there to verify orders youve made that youve already paid for,0
i paid  for a spring roll soup and pad thai,0
good management skills asshat,-1
we had to take our pup to the vet and on our return when we were pulling into our driveway we noticed he was done and our neighbor had grabbed our washer to wash her front patio,-1
you have to try if youre a big fan of sour soup and coconut milk,1
like comon,0
she was kind and very personable albeit  highly overwhelmed,1
call me when you need me woman,0
especially for a joint that has such awesome location building and name,1
my kids thought it would be fun to order their own and hopefully take some home but one ordered a chocolate chip pancake and another ordered a waffle,1
i personally wouldnt order the drinks again if i were back,-1
i did have to park in the back of the parking lot as there werent any spaces left,-1
fortunately i have the reflexes of a cat and smashed it with one of blue martinis excellently durable menus,1
this is a small enterprise and does not have an office staff so they may be slow responding to emails,-1
the idea is that you can reserve a seat in advance and know where you will sit,1
fair deal,1
if i wasnt worried about my waistline id go there a lot more often,1
the good fire not the spicy fire,1
i had raved about this place and posted it on two different local fb pages saying how great it was,1
we wouldnt have left as quick as we did if not for a small family of  across the way receiving their food having finished their order and receiving their second order while we remained at our booth sipping on our waters having gone through our reading material twice already,-1
john the dispatch manager,0
before i check any place any business i always check the reviews,0
when that time came she never returned my call but was very happy to sell me things such as grown crystals from her website,-1
the cheese was good,1
faked me out again,-1
son lost the only key fob to his truck,-1
inside floors still had stuff on them looked like they did a quick job,-1
the gentleman staffing the bar seemed a bit gruff but a good caffeine fix will help me forgive even the orneriest grump,-1
it was nice to have a restaurant that didnt serve pizza in the top five,1
of course thats just one example,0
when we were on one side of the shop she was there,0
as soon as we sat down the waitress brought their drinks which they had ordered  minutes prior and said she would be right back,-1
i stopped in on my way home because i was hungry,0
mgmt moved the outlets to the ceiling,0
i was informed upon arrival that it would cost me a total of ,0
i have had a lot of trouble with accountants in the past not performing and making very expensive mistakes on my returns,-1
its busy and maybe they need more training,-1
the only downfall is on my end that i dont have more friends who like sushi as much as i do,1
to me,0
we also got a steamed chicken dumpling for my son,0
the first rolls were great and we love sushi so we kinda know what we like,1
my hope is in writing this review other see it and do t get scared or bullied into treatments they dont need,-1
but i keep coming back because of the food,1
i ordered the steak salad and my partner ordered the chicken tacos,0
we werent that hungry but did split up and tried a bite of the burger fries and pretzel with cheese fondue,0
reasonably priced with student discounts it takes a few hours to go through all the rooms,1
i answered that it was okay thank you,1
eat at your own risk,-1
they could retire on their greek salad dressing trade secrets,1
 how can we help them,0
impeccable ,1
whats more if you run out of a side dish you can ask for more  same goes for rice and its at no extra charge,1
as if the beef was cut from the holiest cows if the land,1
i was very full at the end of the meal,1
not horrible just awkward,-1
the previous plumber said i needed a new water heater even the one i had was only  years old,0
was it expensive,0
i booked the appointment for  sharp and she arrived at ,-1
we were shocked,-1
i know the strip can be pricey but come on,-1
the decided to give the restaurant a try since it was under new management,0
my favorite place for a good dump,1
moving on i wanted to try the fish tacos but they were out so i tried the pork and steak,0
they had about five reds and five whites to choose,0
youre fooling yourself if you think you know of some where better,1
i decided to go use the washroom and i came across a sign saying how to flush the toilet little things like this should be fixed,-1
they do not really do custom tailoring much more into alterations,0
too die for,1
make sure the floor isnt slippery etc,-1
its not just my party its throughout the bar,0
i rented a pickup to transport a piece of furniture,0
my one complaint is how small that crazy parking lot is super scary,-1
the room is very nice,1
called warranty company old republic and they sent ampm plumbing and got the run around for  days,-1
and so are my gauges,0
thought it would be nice to take my husband to dinner,1
line is always busy,-1
i told him the kind of hair i wanted for my kid,0
it was my husbands birthday and wanted to take him some place differentcalled the restaurant a week prior to driving over from chicago,0
it looked like a windmill with a custardlike cream on top,0
when im on this block again i know i should try one of the other stalls but damn itll be hard not to just return to tt for the exact same order,1
will we be back,0
drawn in by the vibe we were not planning on falling in love,1
charged for the rice you skipped over on,-1
he should be retrained on his customer  service attitude,-1
i will definitely be a return customer for any services i need in the future,1
ever since i came back from ireland ive been looking for a place that comes close to traditional irish food only to be disappointed,-1
weve had  dental experiences at other businesses in las vegas where we felt scammed both times after our first tlc experience,-1
i had our ford fusion get a recall taken care here,0
we watched  other groups sit including a party of ,0
finally   later seated,-1
i got the vegetarian sandwich,0
i had called in advance to see if they offered nondairy milk and was told they had soy and almondyasss,1
when i realized the company i had booked with was another shuttle bus ride away i walked in to ez where i had seen the rate on kayak,0
i mentioned that we were celebrating a double birthday and the employee said she would notate our account so there would be a surprise for them in one of the rooms,1
parking is very limited in back so you may have to get creative with where you park,-1
i sometimes dont even know all the ones i ordered,0
i was intimidated by this magnificent looking sandwich,1
food is not just tossed on a plate,1
i used to go to this location of global pet because we had had such great experiences with the staff,1
without double checking or asking me to show her the wallet i was looking for she immediately told me no we dont have that wallet here,-1
just know that,0
takes about  hours depending on your speed ability,1
they had my bike a month,0
its been over a month since getting my new home and i have yet to get keys to my mailbox for which they say takes  days,-1
the location is tucked away inside of the target shopping center so it can be very easy to miss,-1
i have boycotted the brueggers in mkt square for a few years now and havent really been back to any other location,-1
some other  are really bad at that,-1
went back around told that always rude guy what happened,-1
if you want good pizza i would recommend giannis pizza in hopewell,1
i picked up a two tier cake on saturday  and did not cut the cake until frisay ,0
they are very pushy much more than other companies,-1
we checked in around  and had some friends over,1
however they stayed all day until the job was done and done right,1
i stay in vegas just about every other month and ive never had a worse customer experience and on my birthday weekend,-1
i was struck by a trucks mirror while helping a stranded motorists,-1
her response was what do you want me to do in a very brash tone,-1
we had to box that to go,0
 people could not finish all that food,1
fortunately when we got home and gave the threefourths of it that we had left over to the dogs they were ok with it,1
we made a reservation on open table ahead of time but it wasnt too busy at  pm on a sunday,1
service was okay and the food was good,1
i dont think we paid more than  for uber there from the airport,1
i was sitting in my vehicle following the instructions on the screen,0
we started hiking around  and got back to the parking lot around ,0
it was in fact to sweet for me,-1
une semaine plus tard on me répond que lheure souhaitée nest pas disponible et on me propose alors  ou ,0
upon the advice of my auto insurance agent i had camelback auto glass repair a chip in the windshield of my vehicle to prevent it from spreading,0
eventually a delicious red sangria was selected which went down entirely too fast,1
if u are a smoker this is paradise for u,1
my husband goes back to get it,0
when i first started coming here i was actually surprised how nice and helpful the staff were,1
at other places they can be too large and not too big on taste and quality,-1
on a bright note the mac and cheese was incredible,1
these kids dont deserve your condescending holier than thou attention starved bad attitudes,-1
it was rock hard,-1
just a basic cheese burger,0
yesterday i decided to be the porker that i really am,0
being in the liquor industry you come across a lot of places that have sub par service  andor outrageous prices,-1
our server had our grill switched out about  just to keep our food from burning from each different flavor of sauce they were definitely on top of that,1
i was shocked when he offered to order me a brand new spa with the missing jet and agreed to pay for the crane installation setup and everything,1
i must say that the staff was very friendly tho,1
if youre looking for fine dining this isnt your place,-1
i was so looking forward to this great opportunity and at such an elegant chapel since i was recently engages and eager to get married,1
the only carpeting in our new home was simply in the stairwell from our entry to the main living space upstairs,0
my friend and i came to cibo on a friday night and we decided to sit out on the patio so we could enjoy the nice evening weather,1
cold food and they combined two separate orders in one large container and acted like they did me a favor,1
the driver seemed nice enough interacting with us and joking around,1
or me sliding him  green chips and him playing,0
we had put the do not disturb light on our room but at around  they had called to see if we needed anything  bottled water extra towels,-1
i have to say that i have been back twice in the last month since my last visit which was in the summer and was not incorrect in my suspicions that the new parking and street through the center would ruin the atmosphere,-1
but happy dental has received payment from both insurance carriers so they dont care,-1
she of course kept her attitude the whole time,-1
but when all was said and done our bill came to  and we got  drinks and the bean dip with a double portion of chips so id call that a deal,1
i have used them twice for about  different pieces of clothing and gave very specific instructions as to which articles were to be dry clean only and which were to be laundered,0
at night turns into night club,0
i know where i am making my next appointment,1
thats me,0
it had great reviews and i was also very excited to try the buttery buns yelpers raved about,1
halls are quiet,1
i know things go wrong but this is crazy,1
shitty,-1
i did notice some table get serve better than other,-1
the food is good for fast food,1
i eat out a lot,0
talking about persistent,0
i called a week ahead with some heavy restrictions,0
make a reservation this time and got our table without wait,1
we had a local independent mercedes shop do a ppi a few months ago and they came back with a laundry list of items that needed to be replaced the sending units and fuel tank were not on the list which was contradictory to the ppi done at the mercedes repair shop and private dealership in las vegas where purchased,-1
my bff and i went on a tuesday night at ,0
best thing was the chicken tortilla soup,1
all the recreation a dive bar should have and the scenery of the clientele wasnt bad either,1
maybe he shouldnt have told me that there were other sightings but he offered that info and it was disturbing that no action had already been taken,-1
we had  appetizers at our table,0
too much sauce,-1
stumbled on mangos by accident,0
too many socalled celebrity chefs think that since they graduated from some overseas cooking school bought a couple of tattoos and an attitude their new cooking show will make them cooler than miles davis,-1
the chickpea fries were a little mushy and kinda weird,-1
overall i must say if my kids ever need to jave surgery again,0
ordered five plates of meat  each  three sides  only payed ,1
i had been searching for a lebanese restaurant in toronto to match that of a montreal lebanese restaurant chase,0
 the guy making our food brought us our food and engaged us in a friendly chat for about  minutes ,1
to be fair the food here is delicious and my husband and i used to go all the time,1
our total was about  and the portions were filling,1
burp,0
eventually i was invited to take a seat at the bar and offered a dinner menu,0
you will have a much better experience,1
only complaints are the boneless wings are a bit small and if you call in your order you will be lucky if the answer the phone if its not already busy and dont let them put you on hold they will leave you there forever,-1
i ordered the combo with shrimp enchiladas and need taco with sides of fried potatoes and borracho beans,0
also only the ground beef kebab koobideh not the beef kebab barq any more,0
i was in a hit and run around xmas cops told me i could keep my car on the road til i got it to a repair shop car was towed hours after my accident i couldnt do much being on a bed recovering,-1
although restaurant inside is great my husband and i chose to eat outdoors to see the pedestrians and traffic,1
so i have finally placed my order  large pizza with chipotle steak zucchini and onion,0
your going to get some good service and that your going to eat some good food its vegas right,1
dessert was the tiramisu which we almost licked the cup,1
we called a different company before this and the quote was ridiculous,-1
the restaurant was not apologetic at all ,-1
i found them on yelp and called them,0
to each his or her own but the only negative thing i have to say about reggies is put some blacktop down on your parking lot,-1
came and profusely apologized and offered a delicious filet in exchange,1
upside is the crust is tasty and cooked well,1
it can be crowded and a long wait for takeout and table service is a bit haphazard during busy periods,-1
if its worth collecting theres a good chance they have it,1
so i scheduled an eye exam because i have been having headaches eye strains and dry eyes so figured it had to do with my glasses i have been wearing for the past  years,0
lots of businesses just wanting that quick buck and theyre gone,-1
while waiting for dessert to arrive our server brought us the bill,-1
fortunately  another shuttle company driver offered to give us a ride for free,1
but only one toilet haha,-1
it seems like they serve quiet a few selection of beers and foods  to my surprise and amazement they had an alcohol beverage and keep in mind this is a coffee shop,1
people were getting their orders before me,-1
i had a mishap filling a small hand truck tire with air compressor and the tire exploded,-1
you wont be disappointed,1
i was  certain the tc light would come back on,0
can they get that stuff that turns the water purple,0
i like thick eyebrows that look like they belong together as a pair,1
therefore its a convenient option for showgoers,1
i will be back because of her,1
my favorite place to get an oil change,1
the health department needs to check this location out,-1
i am a very understanding person and realize some times things arent going to be perfect but when my kid is not treated right thats when i cannot be quiet,-1
its my wedding how can you make it up to meyou cant,-1
make sure you get the cheese board,1
i cant help u i was livid,-1
my husband looked at me and asked if i wanted to set up our next appt,0
immediately i wonder why this place isnt busy being in the heart of  during a weekday lunch hour,-1
get there sat,0
one of the barbers came up to me and asked did i have and appointment,0
i asked how much did i owe them,0
decided to check out a new korean bbq place,0
i am a rewards member at michaels and i came across an item that wouldve totaled out as  and my rewards saved me and totaled out to  and i can honestly say that i am a forever returning customer,1
several years ago when this place opened in goodyear the food was served hot and was very tasty,1
or tea,0
you can definitely taste the tea in their milk tea,1
disappointed they are not open mondays,-1
so if you want to eat an awkward meal leaning over a coffee table while sitting on the couch this is the place,-1
wok grill was good and deserts had lots of variety,1
it was worth to wait a while to have my tattoo coloring appointment,1
im fat too,-1
when we asked to hold the butter on the steak the waiter mentioned there was dairy in the potato accompaniments and offered to substitute vegetables without us even asking,1
furthermore the staff there even knows how to treat all of their customers,1
these guys shower up an hour late o my party and showed up away after pick up time,-1
i have tried so many of the online florists and been so disappointed,-1
i would if i could,0
mortons and flemings,0
save room for chocolate bread pudding and banana chocolate in phyllo,1
tony the salesman and partial owner wasnt in our face trying to push product on us,1
i know my insurance i know it wont but he would not let it go,-1
yesterdays nurse and doc were fast and friendly but did not waste our time,1
i ordered  cheese enchiladas combination,0
sushi rock is overpriced and their sushi is subpar compared to this place,-1
yak,-1
unfortunately its  miles away from home,-1
we simply want a unit that works,-1
the only downside is that they dont have fountain sodas so no refills and hot tea is not free either,-1
i was expecting to pay way more than that for that week,1
rather than bulldoze a bank turn it into a restaurant,0
i ordered the regular prime beef,0
they arrive at about  ,0
i really didnt know what to do being far from home and lots of money in camping gear and other stuff in the car,0
i just exited  on dunlap and my car was over heating so i pulled in to the dq there thinking i would let the car cool off and continue on my way to  and eugie ave  at first i just went in to let the car cool down and the manager frank faria came up to me and asked if i had a problem,0
however we did feel they were a bit pushy with purchasing their insurance plan even though we already have our own,-1
on the corner of coventry and mayfield road its one of those places you can drive by all the time and never venture into,0
my biggest issues with my brows in the past is when i get them done i feel like no one has listened to me or looked at them before proceeding,-1
any business that is local and community based gets an immediate  star bonus,1
let me start by saying i have frequent ed this restaurant many times and food is very good,1
a minor thing of note decor was a cross between starbucks and target with lots of red and orange colors not that it mattered but it looked a little strange,-1
cheap strong drinks and hole in the wall,1
paper towels or hand dryers in the bathrooms,0
if you look at my profile,0
food was fine ,1
i ended up going to the pro store at town square and the girl picked three great colors for me,1
food was fine,1
if it forced to eat one type of food for the rest of my life it would be pizza,1
within a day we knew it had to be replaced and a new unit might be  or more days out,-1
apparently you now make it yourself these days,0
i contest the harmonys placement in the dive bar category,0
their full menu is  available here on their website,0
at first glance this restaurant seems destined for success great location to take advantage of the resurgence of downtown willoughby complimentary valet parking an alfresco approach to dining with outdoor tables and chairs flanking erie street smells of freshly baked pizza permeating the air,1
the service isnt bad,1
like instead of pik nampa,0
this was the tip of the iceberg,0
we ordered gyro plates and hummus for delivery,0
needless to say there was not a crumb left,1
the security guard matt came up and saw that i was just sitting there and these women were acting all crazy and yelling at me yet matt made me move,-1

i mean seriously you can go to the metro health civic get your prescriptions filled and get your weekly groceries while waiting,1
it was fun,1
i had a foster dog and was calling a bunch of vets to get a heartworm treatment quote,0
even paid extra for this including  feet of rolled beam,0
i bought a couch from them on ,0
i had read in other reviews to park in an indoor garage and to not leave valuable property in the car and we are kicking ourselves for not heeding those warnings,-1
the customer was just nodding,0
this is an excellent place to go if you want to see how much stress you can put on your relationship,-1
warning though,0
this is shrimp prepared like calamari,0
then there was the rawhide i mean flank steak,-1
i also had a salmon caesar,0
steaks melted in your mouth and i could almost cut it without a knife,1
it is on the expensive side and the clientele is generally high brow pretentious types,-1
lets talk about the service for a minute,0
to be totally fair i should add that the people working this event in scottsdale were beyond nice and pleasant,1
i had gotten a few estimates prior to trying coming here all for full sensor replacement for up to  total,0
the one positive was that the chicken fried rice was delicious,1
dr germaine is a very very nasty man who acts like he is doing you a favor to allow you to be in his presence,-1
before i forget  the soup,0
with this great new staff i have also had three instances where i have had missing items from my order,-1
treated me like a king when i looked like a bum cause i just got off of work,1
this place omgawd,1
i decided to spend a little more money and go to a benefit brow bar,0
surprised this outfit hasnt been sued out of existence yet,-1
lastly does the phenominal presentation of a dish make you sit and stare in appretiation more afraid to eat it because of its beauty,1
the girl who was originally preparing my food resumed and completed making the order,0
never in the fact that so many women that came after me were dealt with immediately,-1
we were afraid we wouldnt be allowed to really enjoy ourselves out there,-1
the honey and orange zest nail it,1
your  servicepeople are overwhelmed,-1
perfect hole in the wall,1
im not usually one that eats leftovers especially pasta,0
friend called a week in advance to reserve for a party of  called twice during week including sat was told all good,0
try jeans if you want great food ,1
i was also having breathing difficulties,-1
its the main ingredient,0
i was very pleased with the treatment i received,1
i had seen some previous reviews on yelp but hadnt thought to check the place out,0
amazon gets it,1
i ordered sushi and a serve of gyoza and they threw in a miso soup,1
definitely no complaints,1
despite being the only customer that afternoon she rushed through my cut,-1
you have to pay cash and you will most likely not find street parking anywhere near there so look for a lot or try the streets around it,-1
we usually order kebab  chicken for my husband and kafta or chicken for me,0
still wont admit when they were wrong,-1
she called him,0
my one complaint was that the air conditioning  heating was a little touchy and we kept having to adjust it,-1
employees standing around,-1
after we sat down,0
they came with a decent maple sauce but i didnt dip very many because they were honestly better on their own,1
the steak at red rock i still cant forget how the beef melted in my mouth,1
the waiter was nice and recommended a grouper with bearnaise sauce sounded good right,1
i stopped eating pretzels for a while in nyc because they were bland to taste as i got older,-1
it felt like we were being rushed out but we still took our time,-1
when you arrive its easy to see why,0
the goodto my surprise though decent food at very good prices had the beef burrito wcheese take out,1
after that we decided as a group to order  sampler platters to share although one of our group ordered a single vegetarian platter,0
a smart company will use that opportunity to impress me not turn me away,-1
ive been home all day waiting for them,-1
first course slightly crispy duck skin though not nearly crispy enough to my liking with fine slices of duck meat to be wrapped in rice paper,-1
unfortunately on the same visit the order taker wasnt paying close attention to my order and so i got a latte that was wasaayyyy sweeter than i like,-1
so close that we had to step back,-1
in addition to that my friend requested salsa and we timed it,0
the shop foreman rode with me to confirm that the alignment was satisfactory before i left,1
well unless you do not like their thin crust,0
my husband and i joined,0
target the store i like,1
the first couple of times werent bad at all,1
im so used to the bs you get at a lot of hipster places that make you feel as if being there and dining there is kind of a burden to them,-1
my only con is that the place is very small  tables max considering its always packed when i go,-1
if your gonna build a stadium some where  make sure the area can take the influx of crowd and traffic ,-1
when i first moved to the complex about  years ago this was a great place to live,1
so my friend i got a drink,0
its actually kind of scary,-1
argh,-1
they should have a buzzer or take down phone number to send a text,-1
if the person helping me hadnt been a dude i wouldve given him a big slobbery kiss,1
the tables that crowd the tiny space make the environment seem too cramped and an intimate night out might be shared with the couple at the table next to you,-1
staff reaction polite frustration security reaction  quick to judge and remove those that complain management reaction  none,-1
beautiful grounds and scenery but i am rating just by the food price and atmosphere,1
im still sitting on the chair,0
i am big fan of arabic food so i was thrilled when paramount opened close to our house,1
broke ass mexican food at hipster prices,-1
its rare to find a restaurant that can perfectly poach your eggs  but alas look no further  the yolks popped upon puncture whites fully cooked,1
i tried a bowl with chicken and tofu,0
a lot of complexes claim to be luxury living but arent,-1
fried calamari and roasted artichokes were good,1
we went to findlay chevrolet  minutes away from where we live and bought a brand new  white colorado that night,0
then on sunday at  received a text saying delivered,0
i called ahead of time to make sure there was a seat available,0
we tried zales kays costco sams club etc,0
some guy gave me his two for one voucher so i was excited to eat at the buffet,1
they do have a great menu and the food is good,1
not so shortly thereafter my friend had to stand up again and ask for the kalbi,-1
you will laugh at yourself for coming all the way out here as i did recently and laugh at the furniture,-1
not a clue what the dressing was but it went well with the salad,1
good luck getting that late of checkout for free at any other highend vegas hotel,1
i brought the same car a small bmw  in for a basic car wash,0
he put it together without asking if it was together or separate,-1
maybe i worked in the service industry too long but in my view you are supposed to say hi,-1
calamari was chewy,-1
sadly the pumpkin pancakes are not available on the weekends,-1
one of the things that made this class attractive to me is that i could meet this requirement within six weeks,1
that being said if youre a restaurant and youre offering food to customers it should be good regardless,-1
found a place he thought i wanted a fill,0
ordered the large boston pizza special,0
it was very quiet  foot soakmassage felt nice,1
the entree choices were  chicken picante pork chops au poivre beef  tips stroganoff over egg noodles and  tilapia piccata,0
ive walked out on five other deals throughout that period due to shady salesmen who must think that consumers cannot do research on cars nowadays,-1
its not the kind of coffee shop that id come to hunker down with my laptop at take meetings or bring a date almost,-1
weve also rented from ez from this facility and had a much better experience than advantage,1
there were not very many free tv channels to choose from basic local news channels and whatever channel shows like friends reruns come on,-1
i honestly could have eaten three or four of them in a row,1
we stayed at the condos in the palms and had a suite for the same price,0
food is kinda like lola rosa in the mcgill ghetto if youve been there,0
well since my schedules a little rock n roll i cant get over there i will someday so i had to try coca cafes version and i must say that it was a tempter if there ever was one,1
when the food came out my eyes got as big as my stomach felt empty,1
the staff was fairly friendly on the phone pizza came in the delivery estimate time,1
in conclusion i really need a new cup of tea and one more cupcake im thinking chocolate this time,1
frustrating,-1
we ate before the event because food was expensive of course,-1
benefit from the coupon thats when you add the stars like bacon sauce etc etc order was ready  also the restaurant calls to confirm your online order and calls again when your order is ready,1
apparently the monthly rental is not suspended during transportation because you are still storing your belongings,-1
give him a call,0
just so happened to stumble into this place because it started to rain,0
weve had tap water everywhere else in vegas and none of it tasted bad like that,-1
if you are in your room when the pool is open the music shakes your window and you can hear it clearly,-1
look i get it,0
book an appointment online before you just show up,0
it is really a tightsqueeze to get through the aisles and the customer traffic,-1
the conscash only,-1
when we were ready she came back to take out order,0
price   for shoes and  for boots,0
this is how they treat our service members,0
there was plenty of open tables,1
ive cancelled appointments on them last minute and they always just reschedule,1
the theater is small so you get to see all the tricks up close and yet we cannot work out how he did any of these  especially the gold fish trick,1
i run a qsr concept just a little advicecustomer service is paramount in this day and time again when someone chooses to eat with you its a privilege and you probably should not take it for granted,-1
once you arrive at a decision look around and see if theres an open register,0
they did this for my mammo six months ago as well,0
just maintenance,0
i have been going to enjoi biweekly for a full set pedi and eyebrow wax for  months now,0
go to brunch spot for the basics eggs potatoes toast and salad,0
the chairs are made of recycled clothing or something funky,0
we ate here over the weekend,0
the only thing i remember was feeling underwhelmed by the bread,-1
the only downfall as mentioned by the other reviews is the design and lack of spaces of the parking lot,-1
i had ordered seared foie gras and coquille st jacques,0
first let me start with the phone conversation,0
the police werent called which seemed to indicate that the surrounding neighborhood had gotten use to having such an unusual place near them,-1
ordered spring vegetable rolls as an appetizer and it was out pretty quickly,1
at least they know how to handle seafood  better than sq and theyre also a food court sushi business,1
since then i have tired of paying the old salon  to do it wrong  of the time,-1
he had called a couple of other places to ask about prices and people only seemed annoyed by his call,-1
maybe  couples,0
it was pretty busy but there was  mistakes on my order,-1
i chose destihl because it is one of the few restaurants in champaign that can accommodate a large party especially on a friday night,1
unfortunately it was raining and we couldnt sit on the patio,-1

i almost wish i had ordered that instead of my fish except my fish had the best sauce in the universe,1
we waited about  minutes when one of the guys comes out and literally flourishes our  bags of food at us,1
only negative and its not really that serious is the cole slaw which is just ok to me and not as good as the other items,-1
the hostess at the front walked us through gave a great explanation of how things worked escorted us to our table gave us a menu and we were on our way,1
the decor has been updated in the last few years i would assume,1
i guess this location is doing a pilot of this new system,0
they ask you how you want it cooked but no matter what i have said it comes out well done and clearly microwaved,-1

you need to get a sim card and get it programmed for international,0
